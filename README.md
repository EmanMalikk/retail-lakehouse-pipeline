**🚀 Project Overview**

This end-to-end data engineering project simulates and processes e-commerce transactional data to generate meaningful business insights and analytics dashboards. We built a scalable data pipeline using Databricks, Apache Spark, and Delta Lake, following a Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to progressively transform raw data into analytics-ready datasets.

⚙️ Step 2: Data Processing in Databricks (Medallion Architecture)

We implemented a 3-layer Medallion Architecture using PySpark in Databricks to transform raw e-commerce data into analytics-ready datasets.

🍂 Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)

01_bronze_ingestion.py / notebook

We loaded raw e-commerce data (CSV / generated dataset) into Databricks and stored it in Delta format without applying any transformations. This layer preserves the original structure of the data for traceability and auditing purposes.

Output tables created:

bronze_customers
bronze_orders
bronze_products
bronze_payments
🔧 Silver Layer (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

02_silver_cleaning.py / notebook

In this layer, we cleaned and standardized the data by removing null values, duplicates, and inconsistent records. Data types such as dates and numeric fields were corrected, and datasets were joined where necessary (e.g., orders with customers and products).

Output tables created:

silver_customers
silver_orders
silver_products
🪙 Gold Layer (Business Aggregation)

03_gold_analytics.py / notebook

This layer focuses on business-level aggregations and KPI generation using PySpark. We built analytics-ready tables for reporting and dashboarding.

Key metrics include:

Total revenue by product
Orders by state
Customer spending behavior

Output tables created:

gold_revenue_metrics
gold_customer_analysis
gold_product_performance
🧾 Notebooks Structure
